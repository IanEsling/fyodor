# Roadmap

Well, version 1 is out the door so what's next? The biggest single item is making Fyodor
Java 8 only, there's a branch called 'v2' that's going to require Java 8 and will introduce
support for `java.time` into fyodor-core and well as additions to the Fyodor API using streams and functions. The 
idea is that this will eventually become the master branch and released as 2.0.0, support
for Java 7 (version 1.x) will continue with bug fixes and additions for the forseeable future until
it is officially EOL'd.

There's a [list of issues on GitHub](https://github.com/IanEsling/fyodor/issues) with improvements in the pipeline
and other ideas, the plan is that they will be implemented and released in the current version 
(i.e. the master branch) and merged into the v2 branch as we go along.

Any other ideas and contributions are welcome, see the [About]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) page for 
contact details.
