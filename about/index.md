We first worked on the idea of random data generators when we were colleagues at [Capita Employee Benefits]
(https://www.capitaemployeebenefits.co.uk/)
 in London in about 2011. Since then we've continued to work with the idea and have re-implemented it several times
 after selling the idea to the different teams we've worked with. We've
  never come across a Java open source library that did what we wanted so decided it 
  was finally time to change that and Fyodor is the result.
