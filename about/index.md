We first worked on the idea of random data generators when we were colleagues at Capita Employee Benefits
 in London in about 2011. Since then we've continued to work with the idea and have re-implemented it several times
 after successfully selling the idea to the different teams we've worked with. In all that time we've
  never come across an open source library we could use that did what we wanted so we thought it 
  was finally time to change that and Fyodor is the result.
