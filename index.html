<p>Fyodor is an open source Java library for generating random data.
    It's distributed under <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">the MIT license</a>
    and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/IanEsling/fyodor">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>It's available in modules, the core module is dependency-free and it's an important goal
    for us that it stays that way. Currently there is also a module supporting Joda Time, and
    a JUnit-dependent module that allows you to reproduce tests that have failed with some random data.</p>

    to get the best from it in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/random-generators">Random Data and Builders</a> or dive into
