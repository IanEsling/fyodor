We've got our release repository synced up with Maven Central!

This means the world can now stick Fyodor in as a dependency and have it magically appear in 
their projects, which is very exciting, obviously. Hopefully we'll have something we can 
call a 'beta' for testing soon with a view to taking the plunge and going live with 1.0.0 
not long after.
