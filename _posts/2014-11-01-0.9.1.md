title: New Release - Breaking Change
---

Version 0.9.1 is now available on Maven Central with a breaking change to the API.  

<!--more-->

Thanks to [caelwinner](https://github.com/caelwinner) for raising a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/IanEsling/fyodor/issues/3) pointing out that
getting the default string generator was inconsistent with the rest of the API:
 
{% highlight java %}
RDG.string;
RDG.integer();
RDG.bool();
RDG.longVal();
RDG.doubleVal();
...
{% endhighlight %}

So all the no-arg default generators are returned via a no-arg method ... except for string which
was actually a public static member of RDG, ooops.  Fixing this unfortunately means a breaking 
change, since we're still in beta we've just removed `RDG.string` (well, made it private) so 
you'll need to access the default string generator with `RDG.string()` from now on.
